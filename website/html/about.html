    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2025, Agora was created to address a gap in the New Zealand market. We saw talented retailers,
            galleries, and artisans struggling to reach their ideal customers through generic marketplaces that didn't
            understand their unique products or values.</p>
        <p>Forget the clutter of generic retail; we focus on the items that tell a story. Whether you're a gallery
            showcasing original artwork, a retailer curating mid-century furniture, or a small nursery offering rare
            plants, Agora provides the platform to reach your perfect buyer.</p>
